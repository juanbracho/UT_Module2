# VBA Scripting Assignment

## Overview
This assignment focuses on applying **Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)** to analyze stock market data. The goal is to learn how to create VBA scripts that automate data analysis tasks, format data, and loop through datasets. By completing this assignment, you will gain foundational programming skills while leveraging VBA to extract insights from stock data.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:
- Write VBA macros to automate data analysis in Excel.
- Implement control flow using `For` loops and conditionals in VBA.
- Format and summarize datasets programmatically.
- Perform calculations, such as percent changes and volume analysis, using VBA.

## Instructions
1. **Retrieve Stock Data**:
    - Loop through one quarter of stock data and store:
      - Ticker symbol
      - Volume of stock
      - Open price
      - Close price

2. **Create New Columns**:
    - Add the following calculated columns:
      - **Total Stock Volume**
      - **Quarterly Change** (calculated as the difference between opening and closing prices)
      - **Percent Change** (calculated as the percentage difference between opening and closing prices)

3. **Apply Conditional Formatting**:
    - Format the `Quarterly Change` and `Percent Change` columns with:
      - Green for positive changes
      - Red for negative changes

4. **Analyze Data**:
    - Identify:
      - Stock with the **greatest percent increase**
      - Stock with the **greatest percent decrease**
      - Stock with the **greatest total volume**

5. **Loop Across Worksheets**:
    - Ensure the script runs successfully on all sheets within the workbook.

6. **Submission Requirements**:
    - Include screenshots of the results.
    - Provide separate VBA script files and a `README.md`.

## Example Output
Below is an example of the expected output:
- Columns for **Quarterly Change**, **Percent Change**, and **Total Stock Volume** filled with data.
- Conditional formatting applied for visual distinction.
- Summary of stocks with greatest percent changes and volume.

## Learning Highlights
### **Module Overview**
